22174738	New	Grand Theft Auto V, Rockstar Games, Xbox 360, 710425491245	<ul><li>Los Santos & Blaine County - The largest open world yet by far, spanning vastly diverse cultural and geographical areas, the entire world of Grand Theft Auto V is open from the very beginning of the game to explore. Visitors to the greater metropolis of Los Santos and the countryside of Blaine County will encounter faded celebrities, meth heads, party people, violent gangs, hikers, bikers and every other manner of colorful denizen. You'll be able to traverse from the tops of the mountains, through the streets of Los Santos, to the depths of the ocean floor.</li><li>Three playable protagonists - Michael, Franklin and Trevor may live in different parts of town, have their own issues, attitudes, lifestyles, desires and goals - but they know how to work together. They have their own unique skillsets to bring to the table when it's time to get the job done. Michael is a veteran bank robber, and an expert with the kind of knowledge that only comes from years as a successful career criminal. A former street gangster now looking for real opportunities and serious money, Franklin works as a repo man for an Armenian luxury car dealership that runs scams on ambitious young hotshots, selling them expensive cars they can't afford. Not interested in living by anyone else's rules, Trevor's a habitual drug user and extremely volatile individual that's prone to destructive outbursts and violent rampages.</li><li>'Recreational' Activity - Grand Theft Auto V is not just massive in scale, but will offer more to get into than ever before. Play a bit of golf or tennis, zen out with yoga or cycle the countryside. Parachute over the city, or customize your Cheetah and take it to the streets to race suckers for money. Or earn cash the old fashioned way, by taking it - whether by ripping off liquor stores or by buying and taking over businesses that will earn you dividends. Even minding your own business having a stroll you may find yourself off on a wild misadventure you never expected.</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V is the largest, most ambitious game Rockstar Games has yet created, and takes full advantage of every ounce of processing power available in the current generation of consoles. In order to provide the best possible experience for such a massive and detailed world, the game will have installation requirements on the Xbox 360.</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V will ship on two discs; Disc 1 will be used for a one-time mandatory install and Disc 2 will be used to play the game. After the install, players will be able to enjoy both Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online without any need to switch discs.</li><li>This initial install will require an Xbox 360 Hard Drive or an external 16GB USB flash drive (sold separately) with at least 8 GB of free space. If using a USB flash drive it must be at least USB 2.0 with a minimum 15mb/s read speed and formatted for Xbox 360 use. A new USB flash drive is recommended to ensure optimum performance.</li><li>Warranty Info: Software license terms in game and www.rockstargames.com/eula; online account terms at www.rockstargames.com/socialclub.

Grand Theft Auto V delivers a world of unprecedented scale and detail bursting with life, from mountaintops to the depths of the ocean. Los Santos: a sprawling sun-soaked metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets and fading celebrities, once the envy of the Western world, now struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and cheap reality TV. Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a former street gangster, now looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life.

41663537	New	SilverStone Technology Premium Mini-ITX / DTX Small Form Factor NAS Computer Case, Black (DS380B)	For users migrating to small form factor (SFF) computers with large libraries of media files, storage capacity is often a compromise that is difficult to overcome. Choosing a smaller case may require additional purchase of external storage enclosure, while choosing a larger case with extra drive bays may defeat the purpose of going SFF in the first place. To fulfill the needs of enthusiasts looking for a no compromise SFF media box, Silverstone designed a cutting edge product, the DS380. With the ability to accommodate standard components such as Mini-ITX motherboards, standard-length dual slot expansion card, and entry-level liquid CPU cooling system, the DS380 can easily handle high end system based on CPU with 95W TDP or above. Equipped with two 120mm intake fans and one 120mm exhaust fan plus externally removable filters on its top and side, keeping everything cool and dust-free is as easy as in any Silverstone premium chassis. Notable features from Silverstone&#39;s famed HTPC cases were also included such as LED indicator with adjustable brightness and lockable front door and power button. Completing what is an impressive SFF case is DS380&#39;s signature feature, a modular eight hot-swappable drive cage design that support both 3.5  and 2.5  drives. It utilizes a custom back panel PCB designed to support both SATA and SAS interface for increased compatibly with nearly all modern hard drives or SSDs. At only 21 liters overall, the impressively small DS380 is perfect for anyone looking to build a powerful SFF NAS for home or office.

40672890	New	Tripp Lite NetCommander 8-Port Cat5 1U Rack-Mount 1+1 User Console KVM Switch	<strong>General Information</strong><br><ul><li>Tripp Lite's B070-008-19-IP KVM Switch gives you a rack-mountable full keyboard, LCD and touchpad in a single console that occupies only 1U of rack space. Easy to install and use, it's the optimal solution for controlling up to 8 computers/servers locally, from across the room, down the street or halfway around the globe on a LAN, WAN or Internet.The B070-008-19-IP uses inexpensive, user-supplied Cat5e/6/6a cabling with Server Interface Units so you can control computers/servers located up to 100 ft. away from the switch. This switch features two 10/100 Mbps LAN ports, so if one fails, the other takes over, keeping remote access uninterrupted. Users can switch easily between the 8 ports using an on-screen display (OSD). Multi-level password protection prohibits unauthorized users from accessing the connected computers, and a local user and a remote user can be logged on simultaneously. The built-in 19" LCD screen supports video resolutions up to 1366 x 768.Two serial ports allow control of serial-manageable devices such as IP PDUs, firewalls and routers; you can assign individual ports to an IP PDU port to power on/off the server connected to that port. The B070-008-19-IP stores neatly in a rack drawer and pulls out when needed. This KVM console is compatible with both Windows and Linux operating systems, and provides remote access using a Windows computer. Heavy-duty steel housing stands up to frequent use. Complies with the Federal Trade Agreements Act (TAA) for GSA Schedule purchases.

44389919	New	Lumix TS30 16MP Compact Camera - Red	<p><p>This tough digital camera is the ultimate companion for travel. No matter where you find yourself - diving with sea life, hanging from a mountain or exploring the winding alleys of a foreign market - you will take the best shot possible without worrying about your camera. Digital camera is waterproof to 26', dustproof, shockproof from 5' and freezeproof from 14 degrees Fahrenheit. Creative control and creative retouch let you easily set the camera to match your scene and use sophisticated presets to optimize the camera settings resulting in photos you'll be proud of.

The red color reproduction of Advanced Underwater Mode easily compensates for the red tones lost in underwater shooting to create more natural underwater images.
